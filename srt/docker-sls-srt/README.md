# docker-sls-srt
Simple HTML / Javascript webpage that shows current bitrate of the DOCKER-SLS-SRT server.

### - These files are to be used with the DOCKER-SLS-SRT server found [HERE](https://hub.docker.com/r/b3ckontwitch/sls-b3ck-edit).

### - If you would like to show just the bitrate use [THIS](https://github.com/b3ck/rtmp-bitrate-html/tree/master/srt/docker-sls-srt/no-rtt).

### - If you would to show bitrate & rtt use [THIS](https://github.com/b3ck/rtmp-bitrate-html/tree/master/srt/docker-sls-srt/with-rtt).
