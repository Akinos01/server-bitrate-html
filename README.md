# server-bitrate-html
##### Simple HTML / Javascript webpage that shows current bitrate of desired NGINX/NMS RTMP & DOCKER-SLS-SRT servers.

### If you would like to use different servers at different times,
### try using the combined version in the [/ALL_SERVERS/](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/ALL_SERVERS) directory.

---
### If you're using NGINX you'll find the needed files in the [/nginx/](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/nginx) directory.

---
### If you're using NMS you'll find the needed files in the [/nms/](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/nms) directory.

---
### If you're using SRT you'll find the needed files in the [/srt/](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/srt) directory.
