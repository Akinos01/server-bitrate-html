# rtmp-bitrate-html
##### Simple HTML / Javascript webpage that shows current bitrate of desired NGINX/NMS RTMP & DOCKER-SLS-SRT servers. (more coming soon)

### - If you're using NGINX you'll find the needed files in the [/nginx/](https://github.com/b3ck/rtmp-bitrate-html/tree/master/nginx) directory.

### - If you're using NMS you'll find the needed files in the [/nms/](https://github.com/b3ck/rtmp-bitrate-html/tree/master/nms) directory.

### - If you're using SRT you'll find the needed files in the [/srt/](https://github.com/b3ck/rtmp-bitrate-html/tree/master/srt) directory.
