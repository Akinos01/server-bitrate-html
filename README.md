# server-bitrate-html
##### Simple HTML / Javascript webpage that shows current bitrate of desired NGINX/NMS RTMP & DOCKER-SLS-SRT servers.

### If you would like to use different servers at different times,
### try using the combined version in the [/ALL_SERVERS/](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/ALL_SERVERS) directory.

---
### NGINX ->> [/nginx/](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/nginx)

---
### Node-Media-Server (NMS) ->> [/nms/](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/nms)

---
### SRT-Live-Server (SLS) or DOCKER-SLS-SRT ->> [/srt/](https://github.com/b3ck/server-bitrate-html/tree/master/srt)
